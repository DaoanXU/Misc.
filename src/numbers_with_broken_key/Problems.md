Situation 
-
We are trying to type numbers, however, one of the number key one the key board is broken.  
Now we are using the broken keyboard to do lable on documents. 
And we want the numbers on lable to be as small as possible.  
This is the back ground. So here is the questions:  

Question 1
-
If the first lable starts with 1 (2 if 1 is broken).
If thers are N documents, and k is the broken key.
What is the largest lable?  
Input  : int N, int k  
Output : int result  
>Example  
(10,9)shoud output 11, (10,1) should ouput 22

Question 2
-
If the first lable starts with 1 (2 if 1 is broken).
If the largest lable is N and the broken key is k. How many documents are there?  
This is just the opposite of Question 1  
Input  : int N, int k  
Output : int result  

Question 3
-
What is the largest valid lable less or equal to a natural Number N?
Input  : int N, int k  
Output : int result  
>Example  
(1234,3) should output 1299

Question 4 & 5
-
Do 1 and 2 in the case that lable starts with 0 (1 if 0 is broken)
